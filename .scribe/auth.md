# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {token}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by registering or logging in. Include it in the Authorization header as <b>Bearer {token}</b>.
